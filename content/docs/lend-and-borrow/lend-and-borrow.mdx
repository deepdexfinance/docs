## What is Lending and Borrowing?

DeepDEX offers lending and borrowing features as part of its decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. These features are a key component of DeepDEX's functionality, powering its multi-asset cross-collateral capabilities for perpetuals trading and allowing users to earn yield or borrow assets for their own use.

## How Lending Works

When users deposit assets into the protocol, they automatically become part of the lending pools and begin to earn yield. This yield is generated from the interest paid by borrowers. The  interest rates (Supply APR) are dynamic and fluctuate based on the supply and demand of each specific asset, dertemined by the utilization ratio which is calculated as `Total Borrowed / Total Deposits`. Yield is paid out periodically and compounds automatically.

Every asset within the protocol is subject to a Supply Cap, which represents the maximum aggregate amount that all users are permitted to deposit. This cap is particularly crucial for less liquid or more volatile assets. By setting this limit, DeepDEX effectively reduces concentration risk and prevents a sudden surge in deposits and withdrawals from depleting the pool's assets.

## How Borrowing Works

To borrow assets, users must first deposit other assets to serve as collateral. The amount users are allowed to borrow is determined by the Initial Asset Weight (IAW) of the deposited asset and the Initial Liability Weight (ILW) of the borrowed asset, where IAW is lower or equal than 100% and ILW is higher or equal to 100%. 

After borrowing, users need to maintain their loans. The maximum amount of loan users can maintain is determined by the Maintenance Asset Weight (MAW) of of the deposited asset and the Maintenance Liability Weight (MLW) of the borrowed asset, where MAW is lower or equal than 100% and MLW is higher or equal to 100%.

More stable assets, like USDC, have higher IAWs and MAWs, allowing users to borrow a greater percentage of their value. In contrast, more volatile assets generally have a lower IAWs and MAWs. Likewise, more stable assets have lower ILWs and MLWs, allowing users to borrow them with a greater percentage against the collateralized assets. In contrast, more volitile assets generally have higher ILWs and MLWs. Liquidations could happen when the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold.
