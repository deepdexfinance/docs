In a centralized exchange, the asset management is custodial, meaning the exchange holds users' assets on their behalf. 

On DeepDEX, asset management is **non-custodial**, meaning the exchange does not hold users' assets. Instead, users' assets are stored in smart contracts. Furthermore, DeepDEX will provide users with a more secure way of asset management, which is called **self-custody**. This feature allows users to protect their assets even when an emergency happens.

## Non-Custodial Asset Management

DeepDEX does not hold users' assets on users' behalf. Instead, it works in a trustless and non-custodial way. When users deposit assets into DeepDEX, they do not send their assets to DeepDEX's wallet, but to a cross-chain bridge managed by DeepSafe, a decentralized and robust network that provides tamper-proof verification for DeepDEX. More information can be found on [DeepSafe website](https://deepsafe.network/).
