DeepDEX is a high-performance, decentralized lending and trading platform for crypto spot, perpetual contracts, built on a self-developed blockchain designed for trading.  
Built in Rust, DeepDEX runs both Rust and EVM virtual machines, delivering ~200,000 on-chain TPS.  
  
## Features
### Consensus Mechanism 
DeepDEX uses the DeepBFT consensus mechanism (a HotStuff variant), providing the core engine for high-performance trading.
 
### Single-Chain (Rust) + Dual Virtual Machines  (Rust + EVM)
An efficient single-chain, dual-VM design.
Rust VM powers high-concurrency transactions, while EVM supports account systems, token protocol, and other applications.  
  
### Low Latency Trading  
With a maximum block time of just 0.2 seconds, DeepDEX provides users with an ultra-fast and seamless trading experience.  
  
### Performant financial primitives  
DeepDEX comes with foundational modules built natively into the chain. This includes on-chain spot and perp order books, lending, oracles, etc.  
  
## Innovations
### Trustless Asset Management
Assets on DeepDEX is safely managed by DeepSafe, a decentralized and robust verification network.

### Portfolio Margin  
All positions share margin, maximizing capital efficiency.  
  
### Multi-Asset Cross Margin System

### Lending/Borrowing  
A decentralized lending feature and a settlement system are integrated into DeepDEX. Deposited assets can be used as margin in trading and automatically earn interest. Users can also borrow and withdraw other native assets.
