DeepDex offers a dynamic and transparent trading environment for perpetual futures. To navigate it effectively, traders should understand the key components that shape market behavior and risk management.

## Spot Market

At the heart of DeepDex's perpetual market is a price feed known as the Oracle Price, which reflects the fair market value of the asset. The Trigger Price is used to initiate Trigger Orders (Stop Market / Stop Limit / Take profit market / Take profit limit).

Trading volume over the past 24 hours offers insight into how active the market is, while the market status indicates whether trading is live or paused.

### Trading Rules

DeepDex charges a taker fee on executed trades. For makers, the fee structure is dynamic—positive values indicate fees paid, while negative values reflect rebates earned.

The platform uses three key parameters to control trade precision:
- Minimum Order Size: This sets the smallest allowable trade.
- Tick Size: This defines the smallest price increment in an order.
- Step Size: This determines the smallest increment by which trade quantities can be adjusted.

Together, these parameters help maintain a clean, efficient trading environment while allowing users to execute trades with precision.

## Perpetual Market

In addition to the spot market, perpetual market maintains a P&L Pool to absorb profits and losses, and an Insurance Fund to cover deficits from liquidations. Open Interest is the total value of positions.

DeepDex Perpetual uses a Funding Rate mechanism to balance long and short positions. When demand skews heavily in one direction, funding payments incentivize traders to take the opposite side. This rate updates periodically and reflects recent market activity.

The Maintenance Margin Ratio (MMR) is the minimum percentage of value that must maintained in the margin account relative to the total value of the total value of the perpetual positions.

Initial Margin Fraction (IMF) factor is a dynamic risk control mechanism used to scale margin requirements based on the size of a trader's position. It increases margin requirements for larger positions and protects the protocol from systemic risk.
