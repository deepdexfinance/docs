title: Funding Rates
---

Funding Rate is a periodic rate applied to perpetual positions to calculate the funding payment exchanged between long and short positions. This mechanism ensures that the price of the perpetual contract stays close to the underlying asset's index price.

- **Positive Funding Rate**: Longs pay shorts. This occurs when the perpetual contract price is higher than the index price.
- **Negative Funding Rate**: Shorts pay longs. This occurs when the perpetual contract price is lower than the index price.

## Funding Rate Calculation

The funding rate is calculated based on the **Premium Index** and a fixed **Base Interest Rate**. The Base Interest Rate (I) is set to **0.01% per 8 hours**.

### Premium Index

The premium index reflects the price difference between the perpetual contract and the index price. It is calculated as:

```math
\text{PremiumIndex} = \frac{\text{Max}(0, \text{ImpactBidPrice} - \text{IndexPrice}) - \text{Max}(0, \text{IndexPrice} - \text{ImpactAskPrice})}{\text{IndexPrice}}
```

where:
- **Impact Bid Price**: The average execution price to trade the Impact Notional Value on the bid side of the order book.
- **Impact Ask Price**: The average execution price to trade the Impact Notional Value on the ask side of the order book.
- **Index Price**: The index price of the underlying asset.

**Impact Notional Value** is calculated as $100 / [Initial Margin Ratio](/glossary#initial-margin-ratio-imr) for each market. It determines the size of the hypothetical trade used to calculate impact prices, helping measure how the perpetual contract price deviates from the index price under realistic trading conditions. 

### Average Premium Index

The premium index is sampled periodically (currently every 5 seconds). The Average Premium Index (P) is the average of the premium index over the funding interval (currently every hour).

### Funding Rate Formula

The funding rate is calculated by taking the 8-hour base interest rate and adding a clamped premium component.

```math
\text{FundingRate} = \text{P} + \text{clamp}(\text{I} - \text{P}, -0.05\%, 0.05\%)
```

The **clamp function** restricts a value to a specific range. If the input value is below the minimum, it returns the minimum; if above the maximum, it returns the maximum; otherwise, it returns the input value unchanged. This ensures the funding rate is equal to the base interest rate when the difference between the base interest rate and the average premium index is within the clamp range [-0.05%, 0.05%].

<Callout>
The funding rate formula applies to an 8-hour period. However, funding payments occur every hour at one-eighth of the computed 8-hour rate.

## Funding Interval and Payment

Funding payments are exchanged every hour.

The amount paid or received is calculated as the product of the [Notional Value](/glossary#notional-value) and the funding rate.

```math
\text{FundingAmount} = \text{NotionalValue} \times \text{FundingRate}
```

## Example

### Example 1: Funding Rate Equals Base Interest Rate

**Parameters:**
- **Base Interest Rate (I)**: 0.01%
- **Average Premium Index (P)**: 0.04%

**Step 1: Calculate the difference**
```math
I - P = 0.01\% - 0.04\% = -0.03\%
```

**Step 2: Clamp the difference**
The clamp range is $[-0.05\%, 0.05\%]$. If the difference is within this range, it is clamped to the range.
```math
\text{clamp}(I - P, -0.05\%, 0.05\%) = I - P
```

**Step 3: Final Funding Rate**
```math
F = P + \text{clamp}(I - P, -0.05\%, 0.05\%) = P + (I - P) = I = 0.01\%
```

In this case, the Funding Rate equals the Base Interest Rate because the premium was within the clamp range.

### Example 2: Funding Rate Below Base Interest Rate

**Parameters:**
- **Base Interest Rate (I)**: 0.01%
- **Average Premium Index (P)**: -0.06%

**Step 1: Calculate the difference**
```math
I - P = 0.01\% - (-0.06\%) = 0.07\%
```

**Step 2: Clamp the difference**
The clamp range is $[-0.05\%, 0.05\%]$. If the difference is above the maximum, it is clamped to the maximum.
```math
\text{clamp}(I - P, -0.05\%, 0.05\%) = 0.05\%
```

**Step 3: Final Funding Rate**
```math
F = P + \text{clamp}(I - P, -0.05\%, 0.05\%) = -0.06\% + 0.05\% = -0.01\%
```
