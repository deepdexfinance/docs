title: Funding Rates
---

A periodic payment exchanged between long and short position holders. It is the primary mechanism to keep the perpetual contract's price anchored to the underlying asset's spot price.

**Calculation:**
The funding rate is calculated using the difference between the market price and the **Index/Oracle Price**.

* If the **Funding Rate** is positive, long positions pay short positions. This happens when the perpetual contract's price is higher than the underlying asset's spot price.
* If the **Funding Rate** is negative, short positions pay long positions. This occurs when the perpetual contract's price is lower than the underlying asset's spot price.
