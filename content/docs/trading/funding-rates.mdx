title: Funding Rates of Perpetual Futures
---

The Funding Rate is a periodic rate applied to perpetual positions to calculate the funding payment exchanged between long and short positions. It is the primary mechanism to keep the perpetual contract's price anchored to the underlying asset's spot price.

**Calculation:**
The Funding Rate is calculated using the difference between the mark price and the **Index/Oracle Price**.

* If the **Funding Rate** is positive, long positions pay short positions. This happens when the perpetual contract's price is higher than the underlying asset's spot price.
* If the **Funding Rate** is negative, short positions pay long positions. This occurs when the perpetual contract's price is lower than the underlying asset's spot price.
