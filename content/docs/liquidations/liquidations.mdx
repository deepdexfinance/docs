## What are liquidations?

Liquidations could happen to an account when its [Total Collateral Value](/glossary#total-collateral-value) is less than or equal to its [Maintenance Margin Requirement](/glossary#maintenance-margin-requirement).

## Liquidation mechanism

DeepDEX utilizes a decentralized, gradual liquidation process.

Once a user's Total Collateral Value falls below the Maintenance Margin Requirement, liquidations would be triggered. 

Steps:

1. All open orders are canceled. 
2. Liquidators can then iteratively liquidate portions of the account's assets and liabilities over a throttled time window. This continues until the account's collateral exceeds the Maintenance Margin Requirement plus an amount determined by the Liquidation Buffer Ratio.

At the time of liquidation, the trade price for the user's perpetual position will be determined by the Index Price. A separate fee, typically set higher than the standard taker fee for the market, will be applied to the liquidated amount to provide an incentive to the liquidator.

## Running a Liquidator Bot

Any participant can run a liquidation bot. Liquidations are executed as position transfers between the user's account and the liquidator's account, which requires the liquidator to have sufficient collateral deposited. 

More details will be provided about how to run a liquidator bot.
