## What are liquidations?

Liquidations could happen to an account when its [Total Collateral Value](/glossary#total-collateral-value) is equal or less than its [Maintenance Margin Requirement](/glossary#maintenance-margin-requirement).

## Liquidation mechanism

DeepDEX utilizes a decentralized, gradual liquidation process.

Once a user's Total Collateral Value falls below the Maintenance Margin Requirement, liquidations would be triggered. 

Steps:

1. All open orders are canceled. 
2. Liquidators can then iteratively liquidate portions of the account's assets and liabilities over a throttled time window. This continues until the account's collateral exceeds the Maintenance Margin Requirement plus an amount determined by the Liquidation Buffer Ratio.

Any participant can run a liquidation bot. Liquidations are executed as position transfers between the user's account and the liquidator's account, which requires the liquidator to have sufficient collateral deposited.
