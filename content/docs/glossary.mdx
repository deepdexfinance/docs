## Core Concepts

#### Index/Oracle Price
The current market price of an asset, which is sourced from external data providers (Currently Pyth) and is used to determine liquidations.

#### Long/Short Position
A **long** position is a bet that the asset's price will go up, while a **short** position is a bet that it will go down.

#### Leverage
The ability to trade a position larger than your initial capital. For example, 10x leverage means a $100 deposit can control a $1,000 position.

#### Liquidation
The forced closing of a leveraged position by the protocol when the trader's margin falls below the maintenance margin level. This happens to prevent a trader's losses from exceeding their collateral.

#### Maker
A Maker is a trader who places a limit order that is not immediately filled.

#### Margin
The collateral a trader must deposit to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as a form of security for the exchange.

#### Mid Price
The average of the best available bid and ask prices on an order book.

#### Perpetual Contract
A type of futures contract that has no expiration date. Traders can hold a position indefinitely as long as they maintain the required margin.

#### Taker

A Taker is a trader who places an order that gets filled immediately against an existing order on the order book.


## Lending and Borrowing

#### Reserve Factor

A parameter that determines what percentage of the interest paid by borrowers is allocated to the protocol. This portion of the interest helps fund the protocol's security and growth.

#### Utilization or Utilization Rate

Utilization measures the proportion of an asset currently being borrowed compared to the total supplied amount.

```math
\text{Utilization Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Borrowed}}{\text{Total Supplied}}
```


## Perpetual Trading

#### Funding Rate
An hourly payment exchanged between long and short position holders. It is the primary mechanism to keep the perpetual contract's price anchored to the underlying asset's spot price. 

#### Initial Margin
The minimum amount of margin required to open a new position.

#### Maintenance Margin
The minimum amount of margin required to keep a position open. If your margin falls below this level, your position is at risk of liquidation.
