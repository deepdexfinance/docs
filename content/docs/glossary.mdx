## Core Concepts

#### Index Price
The Index Price is a price feed that reflects the fair spot market value of the asset. It is derived from a combination of prices from external data sources (currently using Pyth oracle) to provide a reliable and tamper-resistant reference for various calculations, including funding rates, mark prices, and risk management.

#### Leverage
The ability to trade a position larger than your initial capital.

#### Liquidation
The forced closing of a leveraged position by the protocol when the trader's margin falls below the maintenance margin level. This happens to prevent a trader's losses from exceeding their collateral.

#### Maker
A Maker is a trader who places a limit order that is not immediately filled.

#### Margin
The collateral a trader must deposit to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as a form of security for the exchange.

#### Mark Price
Mark Price, derived from a combination of the Index Price and market data, is the reference price to determine the fair, real-time value of positions and collateral for margining, risk checks, and liquidation calculations.

#### Mid Price
The average of the best available bid and ask prices on an order book.

#### Perpetual Contract
A type of futures contract that has no expiration date. Traders can hold a position indefinitely as long as they maintain the required margin.

#### Taker
A Taker is a trader who places an order that gets filled immediately against an existing order on the order book.


## Portfolio Margin

#### Initial Asset Value (IAV)
The initial-level, risk-weighted value of an asset, calculated using its index price. It measures how much of the asset's market value can be counted as initial collateral for opening new positions or borrowing after applying the [Initial Asset Weight (IAW)](/glossary#initial-asset-weight-iaw). For asset $$i$$,

```math
\text{IAV}_i = \text{AssetValue}_i \times \text{IAW}_i
```

#### Initial Asset Weight (IAW)
The risk-adjusted value multiplier applied to each asset when determining how much of it can be counted as initial collateral for opening new positions or borrowing. The range of IAW is $$0 \le \text{IAW} \le 1$$.

#### Initial Borrow Value (IBV)
The initial-level, risk-weighted value of a borrowed asset, calculated using its index price. It quantifies the initial liability after applying the [Maintenance Borrow Weight (MBW)](/glossary#maintenance-borrow-weight-mbw). For asset $$i$$,

```math
\text{IBV}_i = \text{AssetValue}_i \times \text{IBW}_i
```

#### Initial Borrow Weight (IBW)
The risk multiplier applied to each borrowed asset when determining the initial liability value for opening new positions or borrowing. The range of IBW is $$\text{IBW} \ge 1$$.

#### Maintenance Asset Value (MAV)
The maintenance-level, risk-weighted value of an asset, calculated using its index price. It measures how much of the asset's market value can be counted toward the account's maintenance margin after applying the [Maintenance Asset Weight (MAW)](/glossary#maintenance-asset-weight-maw). For asset $$i$$,

```math
\text{MAV}_i = \text{AssetValue}_i \times \text{MAW}_i
```

#### Maintenance Asset Weight (MAW)
The risk-adjusted value multiplier used to assess the maintenance-level collateral value required to keep positions open and avoid liquidation. The range of MAW is $$0 \le \text{MAW} \le 1$$.

#### Maintenance Borrow Value (MBV)
The maintenance-level, risk-weighted value of a borrowed asset, calculated using its index price. It quantifies the effective maintenance liability after applying the risk-adjusted [Maintenance Borrow Weight (MBW)](/glossary#maintenance-borrow-weight-mbw). For asset $$i$$,

```math
\text{MBV}_i = \text{AssetValue}_i \times \text{MBW}_i
```

#### Maintenance Borrow Weight (MBW)
The risk multiplier applied to each liability when assessing maintenance-level solvency. The range of MBW is $$\text{MBW} \le 1$$.

#### Maintenance Margin Requirement
The risk-weighted value of a user's borrows and perpetual positions.

#### Portfolio Margin Ratio
The Portfolio Margin Ratio of an account measures the ratio of the account's [Total Collateral Value](/glossary#total-collateral-value) to its [Maintenance Margin Requirement](/glossary#maintenance-margin-requirement):

```math
\text{MarginRatio} = \frac {\text{TotalCollateralValue}} {\text{MaintenanceMarginRequirement}}
```

When Portfolio Margin Ratio falls below 1, the account is undercollateralized and subject to liquidation.

#### Total Collateral Value
Total Collateral Value, or Total Collateral, is the sum of the aggregate [Maintenance Asset Value (MAV)](/glossary#maintenance-asset-value-mav) for all assets in an account, the [Unrealized PnL](/glossary#unrealized-profit-and-loss-unrealized-pnl), the unsettled funding payments, and the maintenance-level value of assets associated with open spot orders awaiting execution.

#### Total Initial Collateral Value
Total Initial Collateral Value, or Total Initial Collateral, is the aggregate [Initial Asset Value (IAV)](/glossary#initial-asset-value-iav) for all assets in an account and the initial-level value of assets associated with open spot orders awaiting execution.

#### Total Liability Value
The Total Liability Value, or Liabilities, represents the aggregate maintenance-level, risk-weighted value of all liabilities. It includes liabilities arising from borrowed assets, open positions, and open orders.

#### Total Initial Liability Value
The Total Initial Liability Value, or Initial Liabilities, represents the aggregate initial-level, risk-weighted value of all liabilities. It includes liabilities arising from borrowed assets, open positions, and open orders.

## Lending and Borrowing

#### Reserve Factor
A parameter that determines what percentage of the interest paid by borrowers is allocated to the protocol. This portion of the interest helps fund the protocol's security and growth.

#### Utilization or Utilization Rate
Utilization measures the proportion of an asset currently being borrowed compared to the total supplied amount.

```math
\text{Utilization Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Borrowed}}{\text{Total Supplied}}
```


## Perpetual Trading

#### Funding Rate
The Funding Rate is a periodic rate applied to perpetual positions to calculate the funding payment exchanged between long and short positions. It is the primary mechanism to keep the perpetual contract's price anchored to the underlying asset's spot price. 

#### Initial Margin
The minimum amount of margin required to open a new perpetual position.

#### Initial Margin Ratio (IMR)
The percentage of a new perpetual position's value required as collateral to open the position.

#### Long/Short Position
A **long** position is a bet that the asset's price will go up, while a **short** position is a bet that it will go down.

#### Maintenance Margin
The minimum amount of margin required to keep a perpetual position open. 

#### Maintenance Margin Ratio (MMR)
The minimum percentage of the perpetual position value that must be maintained as collateral to keep the position open. Falling below this ratio can trigger liquidation.

#### Notional Value
The Notional Value of a perpetual position represents the value of the position based on the Mark Price, calculated as the position size multiplied by the Mark Price.

#### Unrealized Profit and Loss (Unrealized PnL)
The Unrealized PnL of a perpetual position represents the current gain or loss of an open position based on the Mark Price, before the position is closed or settled.
